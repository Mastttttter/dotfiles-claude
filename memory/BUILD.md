# MEMORY SYSTEM

Recipes for building and maintaining the long-term memory system.

## ARCHITECTURE

- `promoted.md` — source of truth. Curated claims under H2 themes.
- `pages/{index.md,<slug>.md}` — runtime memory, exploded from promoted.md by pages.py. Loaded into sessions via @-include in CLAUDE.md.
- `staging.md` — ad-hoc inbox written by the `/memory-add` skill. Drained into the next weekly UPDATE round (step 3) as `[?]` bullets, then truncated in step 6.
- `pending.md`, `cleaned.md`, `rejected.md`, `distilled/*`, `distill-history.md` — pipeline artifacts. Consulted only during the build pipeline.
- `pitfalls.md` — routing table for fast recall on pitfall triggers, extracted from promoted.py.

## INIT INSTRUCTION

Mine my Claude Code transcripts at ~/.claude/projects/**/*.jsonl into a curated long-term memory file ~/.claude/memory/promoted.md, intended for @-include in ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md.

Pipeline (parallelize via subagents where volume warrants):

1. DISTILL → ~/.claude/memory/distilled/<slug>.md per project (one .md per cwd). Read each session's JSONL, order events by timestamp, keep only user (string content) and assistant (text blocks) where isSidechain=false. Drop <system-reminder>, <command-*>, <task-notification>, "Cache keep-alive..." ticks, "<<autonomous-loop...>>" sentinels, user messages starting with "Stop hook feedback:", and assistant text starting with "API Error".

2. EXTRACT per .md → bullet nuggets. Each: STANDING-RULE claim + line citation + tag in {user-convention, user-correction, costly-error, trial-and-error, foot-gun, friction-point, user-anger, repeating-workflow, env-facts, project-knowledge, project-lesson, remember} → ~/.claude/memory/distilled/extracted/<num>-<slug>.md

3. CLUSTER across projects → one merged file. H2 themes (8–14); merge near-duplicates; carry `(×N sources)` cross-project recurrence count → ~/.claude/memory/distilled/extracted/_merged.md

4. TRIAGE → prepend each bullet with `- [+]`, `- [-]`, or `- [?]` → ~/.claude/memory/distilled/extracted/_triaged.md

5. PROMOTE → ~/.claude/memory/promote.py merges `_triaged.md` into promoted/pending/rejected.md. For a fresh INIT (no carryover desired), remove the three destination files first. promoted.md: pure claim text under themed H2; pending keeps `[?]` markers; rejected keeps citations and metadata.

KEEP: user feedback or conventions against AI defaults, user corrected AI mistakes that likely violate again, stucking errors or costly corrections, repeatitive trial and errors, common pitfalls, repatitive friction point collabrate with user, user feel confused or angry, reusable repeatitive workflows, hard env facts (working projects, reusable utilities, available tools, services, API endpoints, crontab, hardware, identity), durable project knowledges, lessons while building projects, user asked "remember" a thing survives long-term, cross-project recurrence ≥2.

DROP: in-flight project state, plan on paper, hypotheses, reverted changes, AI defaults, narrow empirical findings, context easily obtained from Read/rg/Explore, volatile project-internal mechanics, project file citations, temporary files, opinionated speculations, claims too narrow to justify always-loaded cost.

Bias FALSE NEGATIVES > false positives — promoted memory pollutes every future Claude session. Target ~40–70 nuggets per week. Head to BUILD INDEX after promoted.md creation.

### VALUE MAP

是否值得加入持久记忆，价值评估：

加分项：
- AI 不知道就会犯错，纠正成本很高
- 用户花费大量时间试错产生的结果
- 用户反复纠正 AI 的点，浪费了用户不少时间
- 用户的要求与 AI 默认行为不符的部分

扣分项：
- 频繁变化的中间产物，写入持久记忆后需要频繁更新
- AI 默认就会做的事
- 偶然的问题，不太可能再次用到
- 网上找得到的知识

## UPDATE INSTRUCTION

Incremental update of ~/.claude/memory/. Same KEEP/DROP rules and FALSE-NEGATIVE bias as INIT.

  CONTEXT — do NOT re-extract claims already present in any of:
  - promoted.md, pending.md, rejected.md, cleaned.md
  - distill.py — anchors `--since` on distill-history.md (minus 5 hours margin)
  - promote.py — merge-mode (carryover preserved, dedup by claim text)

  PIPELINE:

  1. DISTILL: `~/.claude/memory/distill.py`. Outputs `~/.claude/memory/distilled/<slug>.md`, one per project cwd. Pass `--since YYYY-MM-DD` (local midnight) or full ISO with offset (`2026-05-06T15:24+08:00`) to override the auto-anchor.

  2. EXTRACT in parallel (one general-purpose subagent per .md). Each agent reads its assigned .md and writes bullets to `/tmp/memory-extract/<slug>.md` in the same format as INIT step 2. Give each agent the H2 theme list of promoted.md.

  3. CLUSTER+TRIAGE in main thread:
     - Read all /tmp/memory-extract/*.md.
     - Drain `~/.claude/memory/staging.md` into the pool as `- [?] <bullet>` entries.
     - Build `distilled/extracted/_triaged.md` with NEW-round bullets only.
     - Mark each `- [+]`, `- [-]`, or `- [?]` under H2 themes matching existing promoted.md.
     - Borderline conflicts with existing memory → [?].
     - Bullet format promote.py parses:
         - [+/-/?] CLAIM TEXT [tag] (×N sources)
           cited: <slug>:L<line>      ← 2-space indent continuation, optional

  4. AUTO-RESOLVE [?] (default):
     - For each [?] in `_triaged.md` and `pending.md`, default to `[-]` UNLESS the bullet adds standalone value not already captured in existing memory file.
     - If a [?] flagged a contradiction with an existing `promoted.md` entry, edit promoted.md to delete or replace the stale entry FIRST, then resolve the [?].
     - Override: edit the marker before this step or say "stop at [?]".

  5. PROMOTE: `~/.claude/memory/promote.py`. Idempotent.

  6. REPORT & BUILD INDEX:
     - Counts: net-new [+] in promoted, audit [-] in rejected.
     - Truncate `~/.claude/memory/staging.md` to empty.
     - Then run pages.py.

## CLEAN INSTRUCTION

Audit ~/.claude/memory/promoted.md and prune entries matching any of:
  1. Completed historical events (e.g. a rename that has already happened, a one-time setup not worth future reuse).
  2. Legacy details superseded by new entries.
  3. Vague meta-advice with no concrete future trigger.
  4. Version-pinned facts that will rot.
  5. Dead link or missing path citations.
  6. Empirical results or numbers.
  7. Direct answer rediscoverable by a quick `rg`/`Read` in a known repo.

For each entry pruned:
  - If a durable kernel survives (methodology, conclusion, sweet-spot rule), keep that kernel and drop the specifics.
  - Otherwise delete the bullet entirely.

Write the originals (verbatim) into cleaned.md, grouped under their original section headers, each entry followed by a one-line deletion reason in parentheses. Then head to BUILD INDEX.

## AUDIT INSTRUCTION

Audit H2 classification in promoted.md. Section titles must be recall-friendly: title alone tells a future Claude which H2 to open.

Ask yourself: Think yourself as a fresh-eye assistant, will you recall the correct memory pages where the relevant truth lies in, based on H2 titles?

Find and fix:
1. Catch-all sections (Misc, "quality", grab-bags) — redistribute their bullets, or split off a coherent subtheme of ≥3 bullets into its own H2.
2. Bullets filed under the wrong theme — move verbatim.
3. Section titles that don't reflect their actual content — rename.

Constraints:
- Move bullets verbatim. No edits to wording.
- Don't create new H2 with <3 bullets.
- Respect CLAUDE.md's "Avoid Taxonomy Hell" — only split when recall genuinely improves.

After editing promoted.md, head to BUILD INDEX.

## BUILD INDEX

Run pages.py. Explodes promoted.md into one page per H2 topic under ~/.claude/memory/pages/{index.md,<slug>.md}. Prunes pages whose topics were removed.

First-time setup: add `@memory/pages/index.md` to ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md (path is relative to CLAUDE.md's directory).

After each distill action, append distill-history.md with local timestamp [YYYY-MM-DD]T[HH:MM]+08:00.

After index build, heads to PITFALLS PROJECTION.

### PITFALL TRIGGERS

`~/.claude/memory/pitfalls.md` is a flat catalog of `TRIGGER → mitigation` one-liners for fast pre-action recall, loaded into every session via @-include in CLAUDE.md.

Agent hand-edits — no script regenerates. After each promoted.md update, run the self-audit below and edit `pitfalls.md` directly.

Trigger must be matchable pre-action (verb-object or "about to X"). Mitigation must be actionable in one sentence.

First-time initialize with:

```markdown
# Pitfall Triggers

When about to do anything matching a trigger below, PAUSE. Read mitigation.

**CRITICAL:** If a pitfall trigger matches your planned action, PAUSE and follow the mitigation.

Format: `- TRIGGER → mitigation.`
```

Self-audit (heuristic, not tag-gated): walk promoted.md and judge each bullet — if it warrants a pre-action trigger entry in the routing table (typical signals: mistake-correction pattern, recurring AI default that backfires, irreversible foot-gun), check whether `pitfalls.md` already carries a matching trigger; insert if missing, reword if drifted. Tags like `foot-gun` / `costly-error` / `user-correction` are hints, not gates — promote based on whether a future Claude would benefit from PAUSE-before-action recall.

Cap at ~50 entries. Beyond that, demote stale or rarely-fired triggers — move details to memory pages, shorten the projection line, or drop entirely.

Quarterly review: audit `pitfalls.md` for entries whose source claim in promoted.md has changed, been removed, or no longer applies. Re-sync rather than letting the projection drift.

## SCRIPTS TO USE

- distill.py for DISTILL
- promote.py for PROMOTE
- pages.py for BUILD INDEX

## WEEKLY ROUTINE

Suggest the user to run UPDATE + AUDIT + CLEAN weekly by saying "weekly memory distill".
